# PIR

This repository is linked to a former research project from my MSc. The initial purpose of this repository was not to present or make usable the results of this project but to bring them together.

The goal of this project was to implement a simple version of DQN and AdaNet in order to adapt the latter to solve reinforcement learning problems.

A usable version of the algorithms developed during this project in the form of a package will be available soon.
